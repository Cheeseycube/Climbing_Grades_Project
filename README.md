# Climbing_Grades_Project

## About this project:
 * This repo contains my capstone project for my Associate's Degree at Great Bay Community College.
 * The project is an ambitious attempt at re-inventing how commerical climbing gyms grade their climbs.
 * In particular, my goal is to create a consistent and reasonable model for grading climbs that all gyms could some day follow--as opposed to the current system of    basically grading climbs by feel.
 As of March 2023, I have created a simple but functional maximum likelihood model that predicts grades using Bay'es Theorem.  
 * Once I have more data and time to work on this I will explore other more advanced models and collect more data.
 
## How to use my code:
 * If you want to test the model yourself, run the Climbing_Grade_Proj_Maximum_Likelihood_Estimation.py file and follow the instructions
 * The model is based off specific guidelines as to what defines a "crimp", or "jug", etc. but for convenience I suggest you use your own judgement.  
 * Collecting data for this was very slow and tedious so due to a general lack of data in the higher grades the model is best used on V0-V3 climbs.  
 * If you really want to thoroughly test my experimental model you can reach me at jroussos01@gmail.com and we can talk.
 
## What even is climbing anyway?:
 * For those who aren't familiar with the climbing industry or why this project is important, I made a short video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWCtOOlb2I
